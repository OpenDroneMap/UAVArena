# UAV Arena

Drone mapping software results, compared side to side!

## Methodology

The results are processed for each software using using “medium quality” / default settings, 2 cm/px resolution.

## Contributing

If you want to add a new dataset, simply add the relevant folders in the `data` directory, edit `main.js`. The tiles can be generated using the instructions in `tile_commands.txt`.

## Disclaimer

While this is a neutral zone for evaluating the results of drone mapping software and we have performed processing following 
the same standards / quality settings for all solutions, we should disclose that UAV4GEO is actively involved in the development of [ODM](https://github.com/OpenDroneMap/ODM).

If you found a problem in one of the software results, submit a PR.
